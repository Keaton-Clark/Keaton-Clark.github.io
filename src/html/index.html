		Hi,
		<br>
		<br>
		My name is Keaton Clark, and I am a sophmore Computer Science major at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
		My main fields of interest are in artificial intelligence/machine learning, and embedded systems.
		Outside of school I enjoy playing basketball, reading Russian literatue, and brewing beer with my father. We have a mean red ale.
		<br>
		<br>
		My first year, I was actually enrolled as a Chemical Engineering major with hopes of joining the Navy as a Nuclear Engineer on a submarine,
		however I quickly determined that this major and career choice was not for me.
		Until the summer between freshman and sophmore year, I had never previously considered Computer Science as even an option for my major or future.
		In hindsight, it is hard to believe this as I have always shown a natural affinity to all things computers. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Around my second year of high school, a teacher who was very influencial to my future set me on this path to software devolopment.
		Ironically while he was responsible for introducing me to all things Chemical Engineering as he was previously a Chem-E at UNR, 
		he also introduced me to linux, latex, and most importantly, arduino.
		He was assigning our end of the year project, which was to build a remote controll hovercar, and we had been working with mindstorms for the entire year,
		however he approached me and handed me and gave me an arduino, bread board, and a couple of servo motors from his own collection and told me to do the
		project with those, and it was the most enjoyable project I had ever done in my academic career.
		<br>
		<br>
		With this as a jumping off point, I learned most basic concepts by self teaching methods and did what was most enjoyable to me,
		which almost always included robotics and embedded systems with arduinos.
		Recently I have been learning a lot of low level devolopment to expand upon my skillset in embedded systems. 
		I have been teaching myself some assembly as well as exploring simple gui's that can be implimented with the frambuffer file on linux.
