			Personal project for my own particular interests. I decided that a really cool look for my website would be to have some sort of interactive game
			or automatic visual for visitors to enjoy, so I settled on building an algorithm that autoplays and eventually completes a game of snake.
			There is more infortmation about how the algorithm works on this page of the website.

		<a class="project-card-CS-1" href="https://github.com/Keaton-Clark/Keaton-Clark.github.io">
			Group project for CS-201 in fall of 2021.
			This project was worked with two other students, Kurt and Isaiah, their information and contribution can be found in the README.
			The goal was to develop a shippable program that allowed the user to load and manipulate .wav files with a variety of common sound file operations.
			My involment was to develop all of the backend processes and the challenges that entailed: 
			binary file reading and writing with endianess, algorithms to imitate an echo effect, and algorithms to normalize, apply gain to the file and more.

		<a href="https://github.com/Keaton-Clark/calcpp" class="project-card-calcpp">
			Personal project with heavy influence from the open source project "speedcrunch", calcpp is an ncurses based calculator
			designed to be entirely keyboard operated. Currently it supports the basic operators on both integers and floats, negative numbers, and variables.
			In the future I will be implementing common functions such as sin and natural log, a list of common engineering constants such as the variations
			of the ideal gas constant as well as a menu to view the available constants and the units on them.
			I will include a way to implement your own functions and a rudemntary graphing or table view for these functions as there is no gui to view curved lines.

		<a href="https://github.com/Keaton-Clark/tmplt" class="project-card-tmplt">
			Personal project to increase productivity. In order to get familiar with bash scripting I wrote a script to auto setup repositiories, tex documents
			and other directory layouts. It locates its templates in ~/.Templates and renames the parent directory as well as all folders in the immediate child
			directory to the second argument you pass it. Currently it recursively searches through all child directories for files containing keywords and
			supplies the option to replace these strings.
